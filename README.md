## Overview 

FoodTrace is a comprehensive blockchain-based food origin tracking system that provides complete transparency and immutable tracking of food products from farm to table. The application leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to create a secure and verifiable supply chain record, enabling consumers to trace the complete journey of their food products including origin, processing, and distribution stages.

The system successfully combines a modern, responsive web frontend with smart contract integration, offering real-time tracking capabilities, quality scoring, and certification verification. Users can input product IDs to retrieve comprehensive tracking information, view supply chain stages with visual timelines, and verify the authenticity and quality of food products through blockchain-verified data.
